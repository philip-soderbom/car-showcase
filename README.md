# Project description

In this project, Next JS 13 is used with TypeScript to build a web app for a car showcase firm.

This project includes the following:

- Next.js 13
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
  - Headless UI: `npm install @headlessui/react`
- Sass: `npm i sass`
- Fetching data from API: https://rapidapi.com/

Most styling is done in globals.css (which also handles responsive UI), but for smaller components like the `<CustomButton />` component, Sass is used in a separate style sheet style.scss in the same folder as the component itself.

All types are defined as interfaces in the folder `/types/index.ts`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
